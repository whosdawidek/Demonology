**“Demonology”** is a full-scale Minecraft world overhaul, introducing a complete demonic ecosystem built on a multi-layered architecture of biomes, factions, and rituals. The project redefines gameplay by adding new zones, enemies, progression systems, and advanced AI logic, creating a high-intensity environment with deep strategic complexity.

The mod expands the world with a suite of biomes with unique DNA — from the **Abyssal Rift** to **Flesh Wastes**, **Void Mire**, and **Obsidian Highlands** — each featuring exclusive events, environmental hazards, and rare resources critical for later stages of the game. Within these zones operate four rival demon factions that escalate conflicts, launch invasions, and dynamically respond to player actions.

At the core of the mod lies the **ritual system**, allowing summoning, global world modifications, and the triggering of catastrophic events. Players progress along the **Demonologist path**, unlocking talents, corruption modifiers, and access to **Soulforged** weapons and artifacts with high power potential.

The experience is rounded out by a portfolio of **dungeons** — from **Infernal Citadels** to **Veil Archives** — featuring procedural layouts and bosses with multi-phase mechanics. **Demon AI 2.0** delivers tactical behavior, group coordination, and context-sensitive reactions based on biome, faction, and world corruption levels.

**“Demonology”** is an endgame-ready solution that calibrates the entire game ecosystem for more challenging, dynamic, and strategic gameplay, maximizing player engagement and replay value.
